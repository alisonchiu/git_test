        Yo listen up, here's the story <br>
        About a little guy that lives in a blue world <br>
        And all day and all night and everything he sees is just blue <br>
        Like him, inside and outside <br>
        Blue his house with a blue little window
        And a blue Corvette <br>
        And everything is blue for him <br>
        And himself and everybody around <br>
        'Cause he ain't got nobody to listen
